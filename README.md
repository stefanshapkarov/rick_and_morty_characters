# Rick And Morty Characters

This project is a front-end implementation of https://rickandmortyapi.com/ using graphql and React with Next.js.

### Running the project

After cloning the project locally, enter the project directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Once everything has been installed simply run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then from the console you can see the port on which the project is running and access it from the browser.

Since it is running locally the url should be something like:
```url
http://localhost:[port]
```
